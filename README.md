Project Information here: https://bit.ly/2lZpIcN

# For now, let's just serve this locally with this command

`php -S localhost:8000`

# We're using Laravel Mix to build static assets

From the project root, run `npm install`

Next, you can get the static assets to build by running `npm run dev`

To have the system watch your source files, and rebuild on the fly, run `npm run watch`
